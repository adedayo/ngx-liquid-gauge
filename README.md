# Angular Component for Curtis Bratton's D3 Liquid Fill Gauge

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-liquid-gauge.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-liquid-gauge)

I really liked Curtis Bratton's D3 Liquid Fill Gauge (code here: http://bl.ocks.org/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6) and wanted to use it in an Angular project, so I turned it to a component and packaged it as a module in case somebody else finds it useful.

In the process I upgraded the D3 API and made minor modifications to Curtis' code along the way as I converted it to Typescript from Javascript. However, all credits go to Curtis! My contribution was just the Angular component wrapper.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install 'ngx-liquid-gauge' with npm

```
npm install ngx-liquid-gauge
```

2. Import 'NgxLiquidGaugeModule' in your Angular Module

```javascript
import { NgxLiquidGaugeModule } from 'ngx-liquid-gauge';

imports: [ ...... , NgxLiquidGaugeModule ],
```

3. Use 'lib-ngx-liquid-gauge' component inside a template

```html

<h2>Setting just the gauge value</h2>

<lib-ngx-liquid-gauge [value]="22"></lib-ngx-liquid-gauge>
